# Full Repository Name 
SatCom-Workshop 

This repo contains the files required to run the hands-on, MATLAB-based  
SatCom workshop.  The "Work Scripts" files require code additions in order to  
run.  The "Solution Scripts" files have the required code additions, and run  
to completion.

The files enable the following exercises:  
1.  Exercise 1 - Launch a satellite scenario viewer.  
2.  Exercise 2 - Perform a satellite-to-ground station visibility analysis.  
3.  Exercise 3 - Perform a satellite-to-ground station communications link closure analysis.
4.  Exercise 4 - Visualize the antenna patterns from Exercise 3.    

All the exercises include visualizations.

<!--- If your project includes a visualation or any images or an App please include a screenshot in this README --->

## Setup 
To Run:
